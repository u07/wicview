Windows Imaging API client - metadata viewer

- An auxiliary tool. Handles images and shows available metadata tree, obtained through the standard system interface - Windows Imaging Component (WIC). 
- Shows human-readable descriptions for EXIF tags (editable, stored in .txt)
- Read-only. Does not modify data.

Made to see what WIC can do for you. Not so much, as it turned out... At this moment it looks like a lack of extended XMP support (or I'm doing it wrong :)

keywords: jpeg, jpg, jpe, tiff, gif, jfif, gps, ifd, ushort, xmp, app0, app1, app12, app13, photoshop, adobe, not a WICExplorer, IWICMetadataQueryReader, яШяа, Delphi XE.
